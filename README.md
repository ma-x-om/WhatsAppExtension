# WhatsAppExtension
open and go to a chat with a copied telephone number

If you don't know how to install a extension, do the following:

1. Go in chrome://extensions/
2. Activate "Developer Mode"
3. Choose "Load with no compacting"
4. Select the folder with the codes

The extension's use is simple:
- It will retrieve whatever text is in the clipboard
- You can manually insert the text too
- If you press Enter or press "WEB", the form will be submited and a WhatsApp Web page will open
- If you press "APP" it will try to open a possibly installed WhatsApp app
- NOTE: it is programmed for Brazil, so it will insert 55 at the start of the number
